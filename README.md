# weather-forecast2nd


## description
My motivation to do this project is learning more about javascript and the use of an API, experiment with different code and improve my skills. I built this project to create a weather Dashboard  this can be used to  look for a city . I created an interactive page to get the current weather and the forecast 5 days after the current date.
